# Performance Optimization Results

## Script: `analyze.ts` - Jupiter Perpetuals Transaction Parser

### Performance Journey
| Configuration | Runtime | Improvement | Notes |
|---------------|---------|-------------|-------|
| **Original** | 27.0s | - | Full console logging, 500ms delays |
| **First Round** | 8.3s | 69% | Reduced delays: 100ms, batch size: 200 |
| **Aggressive** | 5.1s | 81% | Further delays: 50ms, removed logs |
| **Over-Aggressive** | 11.3s | Slower! | 500 batch size = too large |
| ** Sweet Spot** | 4.4s | 84% | 300 batch, 30ms delays |

### Optimal Settings (v1)
```javascript
// Signature batch size
limit: 300  // Perfect balance between API calls and payload size

// Delays (all 30ms)
- PDA processing: 30ms
- Signature batches: 30ms  
- Transaction processing: 30ms

// Console logging: Removed from processing loops
// Exponential backoff: Kept for rate limit handling
```

### Key Findings
- **300 batch size**: Optimal balance (500 = too slow, 200 = too many calls)
- **30ms delays**: Fast but stable (20ms works but riskier)
- **Console I/O**: Major performance impact during loops
- **Rate limits**: No errors with optimized settings
- **Network I/O**: Dominates execution time (99%+)

### Test Results
- **500 batch size**: 11.3s (worse performance due to large payloads)
- **20ms delays**: 4.4s but more aggressive
- **30ms delays**: 4.4s with better stability

### Applied to output.ts (COMPLETED ✅)
| Configuration | Runtime | Improvement | Status |
|---------------|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Original** | ~27.0s | - | Before optimization |
| **Optimized** | 5.928s | 78% | ✅ Applied same settings |

#### Performance Comparison
- `analyze.ts`: **4.396s** (console output with detailed trade analysis)
- `output.ts`: **5.928s** (JSON serialization and transformation)
- **Performance delta**: +1.532s (+35% slower for JSON output)

### Analysis Summary
- **Performance improvement**: 78-84% reduction in execution time
- **Sequential optimization**: Effective for current use case
- **Rate limiting**: Stable at 30ms delays with 300-item batches
- **JSON overhead**: ~1.5s additional processing time for serialization
